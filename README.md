# Circular Linked List (Java)

The creation of a Circular Linked List data structure as defined in an assignment for the class "Advanced Programming in Java & Python". This data structure fits all of the functionality required by the assignment, but could certainly use more functionality for the general usages. Unfortunately, the assignment PDF for this program has been lost now that my enrollment in the class has been completed. If I find the pdf file for the assignment, I will update the repository. Otherwise, each java file contains a large comment block specifying what each class and member function is doing.
